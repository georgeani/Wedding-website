# Wedding-website

Tasks for the coursework for the Web Programming Module in First Year.

the goal was to create a website that helps the user to choose the right Wedding venue. An SQL server was used to hold the data about the venues and queris was used to access the data and help the user to choose the correct Weding Venue

## Tasks

    Task 1- catering.html
    Task 2- details.html
    Task 3- capacity.html
    Task 4- costs.html
    Task 5- wedding.php

Tasks 1-4 involved creating the php files that encapsulated the data manipulation and presentation. They were based o the HTML files and their main goal was to mean the requirements of the coursework. Task 5 allowed for multiple files to be created in order to accomplish the goal and add interactivity to our websites. Jquery was used and a custom look was implemented.
